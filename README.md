# Little training on JS 

The purpose here is to challenge your logical thinking on *Object-oriented programming* by recoding some functions of the famous *Lodash library*.

For your information, Lodash is released under the MIT license & supports modern environments and makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. (https://lodash.com/)

Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

  - Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
  - Manipulating & testing values
  - Creating composite functions
